            <h2>Our Love Story</h2>
            <p>Ajay and Rishitha were software engineers. Ajay was working in Infosys and Rishitha was in TCS. Both were appointed at Hyderabad offices. They were asked to meet by their parents as a part of match-making process. They talked about jobs, families, career plans, and habits. When they discussed about their past relationships, Rishitha admitted that she had one love failure story. She explained about her unrequited love story, how she had fallen for her crush, how she was unable to tell her feelings to that guy, how much pain she endured when that guy got married recently.</p>
            <p>They got married. On their first night, he decided to postpone their intimacy as he was feeling nervous and instead he wanted to know more about her. He asked her to bring her photo album. She brought it and sat aside him explaining about the pictures. He saw her two month old picture, name day pictures, first school day picture, and puberty function pictures. She was explaining him about each and every picture and they were sharing laughs. Now, he was looking at her 10th class pictures. She stopped explaining and her heart beat became faster and faster for each passing second. He turned the page. He saw a picture of a girl performing on stage, having Indian flag colours on cheeks. He was in a deep shock. He rubbed his eyes and saw at the picture once again. His first crush’s picture. He looked at her and she turned her face other side and smiling. She didn’t say a word.</p>
